# File Sharing System 

In this project, you will be developing a file-sharing server. A file share server is a computer or server that enables multiple users on a network to access and share files and folders in a central location. It allows users to access files on various devices. You will create a server file system simulator to store all the files created by clients. 


This repository contains two projects: the client and the server. You only need to modify the server.
